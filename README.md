# esp32cam-demo
esp32cam module demo / project starting point sketch using Arduino ide


This is a starting point sketch for projects using the esp32cam development board with the following features
 *        web server with live video streaming
 *        sd card support (using 1bit mode to free some io pins)
 *        io pins available for use are 13, 12(must be low at boot)
 *        flash led is still available for use on pin 4
 
 I found it quiet confusing trying to do anything with this module and so have tried to compile everything I have learned so far in to 
 a easy to follow sketch to encourage others to have a try with these powerful and VERY affordable modules...

created using the Arduino IDE with ESP32 module installed   (https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json)
No additional libraries required
